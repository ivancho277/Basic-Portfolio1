        <p>My name is Ivan Rouskov. I was born in Sofia Bulgaria, but lived most of my life in Washington state. I am currently studying to be a web / software developer. My favorite activities are Skiing and ballroom dancing. I was a dance instructor for 4 years and a competitor for 8. Recently I have began training in Muay Thai and Jujitsu. Other than my hobbies I enjoy music, any genre but I am geared mostly to electronic.</p>
