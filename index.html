                 <p class="abouttxt">My name is Ivan Rouskov. I was born in Sofia  Bulgaria, but lived most of my life in Washington state. I am currently studying to be a web / software developer. My favorite activities are Skiing and ballroom dancing. I was a dance instructor for 4 years and a competitor for 8. I also grew up downhill ski racing for 10 years, my home mountain being Alpental and Snoqualmie pass. Recently I have began training in Muay Thai and Jujitsu. Other than my hobbies I enjoy music, any genre but I am geared mostly to electronic. I also enjoy DJing in my spare time and creating music. My soundcloud has some mixes and songs I have made, as well as a lot of music I enjoy listening to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ivancho277" class="soundcloud">Link to my soundcloud</a>. </p>
